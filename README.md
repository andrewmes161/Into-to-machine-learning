# Into-to-machine-learning

For this project, we took and existing code framework and designed a learning AI that is able to navagate from the top left corner of the screen to the bottom right of the screen. A majority of the functions were supplied for us.
However we had to put it all together in order to make the AI work. Towards the bottom, I've commented in the code where my own code begins.

This entire semester I've learned a lot about the responsibility that computer scientist have when it comes to the technology that they create. As AI becomes more and more intwined within our own world, the ethical dilemmas surrounding
these technologies are going to fall directly in the hands of their creators. During this course, we were introduced to several examples of how an AI created with good intentions is able to inherit biases during their learning processes. 
One way of midigating this is to realize that technology is always in continuing development. By asking these hard questions at the begining and throughout development, these hard issues can be curbed or even eliminated. We should also realizing that 
at the end of the day that the technology that we create is for the user and not ourselves. The goal of technology is to improve lives, and not to make it more difficult. Therefore we consider all users, and not just the majority of users who use it.
